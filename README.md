# Features
- 7 x 10 White LED Charlieplexed display (placed in a slight perspective to match the Vectrex artwork!)
- Joystick is a 1-button capacitive touch controller
- PIC16F886 8K MCU
- Speaker (auto mutes if not playing, or can permanently disable with removing a solder blob)
- Coily cord!
- Jumpers for hacking, control it via I2C directly if you want from a main badge... and there's PWM input for the speaker and touch controller output for sensing button presses available to wire to the SAO connector.
